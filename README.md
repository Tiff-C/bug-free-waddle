# Dashboard app - Next.js Tutorial
This is a space to practice developing using the Next.js framework. After completing the inital training material from the Next.js website I moved onto the the [Dashboard App Tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/getting-started). As part of this I had to delete the current app files created in the basic learning, please view commit [849815e](https://github.com/Tiff-C/bug-free-waddle/commit/849815efa6b2c5c1143405b35409076acef28e9d).

## Getting started

To download the preprepared code for the tutuorial I ran the below code in the command line.
```
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example"
```

After running the below list of commands were listed in the terminal:

```
Success! Created nextjs-dashboard at <folderName>
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm run dev
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Builds the app for production.

  npm start
    Runs the built app in production mode.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd nextjs-dashboard
  npm run dev
```

## How to run this project

Open the project and install dependencies, these can be found in the `package.json` file.

Once installed, run the below comman in the console. 
```
npm run dev
```
